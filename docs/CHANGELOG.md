# Changelog — tcg-decks

All notable changes to this project are recorded here.

## How to use this file

- Under `**[Unreleased]**`, add bullets or subsections for each task or PR-sized chunk of work (what changed, why, notable paths, follow-ups).
- When cutting a release, move content from `[Unreleased]` into a dated section: `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Tie entries to backlog IDs in [BACKLOG.md](./BACKLOG.md) when applicable.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Collection discoverability and floating identity** — Signed-in chrome now links to Collection (sidebar + mobile profile Navigation). Desktop `/collection` has a left identity pill; the coming-soon stub uses dashed `border-border/80`.
  - **Context:** Issue #32 (port of PR #44 which landed on `master` only).
  - **Decisions:** Title-pill-only header matching Teams decks; do not build collection tracking.
  - **Files:** `src/components/shell/main-nav-build.ts`, `src/app/(app)/collection/collection-page-client.tsx`, `docs/floating-header-islands.md`.

### Added

- **Product tour sizzle reel** — Fullscreen interactive feature tour at `/tour` with auto-advancing beats, keyboard controls, and a Home “Watch Tour” entry.
  - **Context:** Request for a web sizzle reel to showcase product features.
  - **Decisions:** Standalone route outside the app shell (no floating header); CSS feature stages instead of live screenshots; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  - **Files:** `src/app/tour/page.tsx`, `src/components/tour/sizzle-reel/*`, `src/app/(app)/home/page.tsx`.
