# Changelog — tcg-decks

All notable changes to this project are recorded here.

## How to use this file

- Under `**[Unreleased]**`, add bullets or subsections for each task or PR-sized chunk of work (what changed, why, notable paths, follow-ups).
- When cutting a release, move content from `[Unreleased]` into a dated section: `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Tie entries to backlog IDs in [BACKLOG.md](./BACKLOG.md) when applicable.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Deck details mobile sticky chrome** — Phone-width owned-deck sticky bar exposes the full title via tap-to-expand, shows visibility + format on a second row so the format badge no longer starves the name, and uses 40px icon actions (Set Active / Edit).
  - **Context:** Issue #67 (port onto `dev`; prior PR #90 merged to `master`).
  - **Decisions:** Keep desktop floating Set Active / Edit pills unchanged; visibility in sticky chrome is read-only state (edit remains the change path).
  - **Files:** `src/components/deck-details/deck-details-top-bar/{title-section,content,view-actions}.tsx`.

### Added

- **Product tour sizzle reel** — Fullscreen interactive feature tour at `/tour` with auto-advancing beats, keyboard controls, and a Home “Watch Tour” entry.
  - **Context:** Request for a web sizzle reel to showcase product features.
  - **Decisions:** Standalone route outside the app shell (no floating header); CSS feature stages instead of live screenshots; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  - **Files:** `src/app/tour/page.tsx`, `src/components/tour/sizzle-reel/*`, `src/app/(app)/home/page.tsx`.
