# UI and UX design — tcg-decks

## Principles

- **Progressive disclosure** — Deck and collection tools should surface the next action clearly without crowding primary canvases.
- **Consistent shell** — App chrome, mobile sheets, and sidebars should behave predictably across routes (`src/components/shell/`).
- **Accessible controls** — Prefer Radix-backed primitives; preserve focus order and semantics in custom widgets.
- **Performance** — Large lists (cards, deck rows) should use windowing or pagination patterns where needed; avoid unnecessary client subscriptions.

## Implementation alignment

- **Composition:** Follow [component-architecture-playbook.md](./component-architecture-playbook.md) so dialogs, panels, and pages stay small and testable.
- **Theming and styling:** Follow [theme-chrome-guidelines.md](./theme-chrome-guidelines.md) for token ownership, ladders (border, surface, elevation, radius, z-index, motion, type, backdrop), and authoring. Session-backed preferences and DOM attributes are in [theme-and-chrome.md](./theme-and-chrome.md).
